# Can Cross-domain Term Extraction Benefit from Cross-lingual Transfer and Nested Term Labeling?

## 1. Description

In this repo, we further extend our work in [Can Cross-domain Term Extraction Benefit from Cross-lingual Transfer?](https://github.com/honghanhh/ate-2022) by introducing a novel nested term labeling mechanism and evaluating the performance of the model in the cross-lingual and multi-lingual settings in comparison with the traditional BIO annotation regime.
